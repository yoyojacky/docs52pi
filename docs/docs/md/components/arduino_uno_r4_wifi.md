# Arduino UNO R4 Wifi 

## UNO R4 Wifi
The Arduino UNO R4 WiFi is designed around the 32-bit microcontroller RA4M1 from Renesas while also featuring a ESP32 module for Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® connectivity. Its distinctive 12x8 LED matrix makes it possible to prototype visuals directly on the board, and with a Qwiic connector, you can create projects plug-and-play style.

## Feature

The MCU on the board is the high performance Renesas RA4M1 (Arm® Cortex®-M4) with a 48 MHz clock speed, 32 kB SRAM and 256 kB flash memory. This MCU features an RTC, a DAC and a CAN bus and has support for HID via USB.

The UNO R4 WiFi also features an ESP32-S3 for Wi-Fi®/Bluetooth® connectivity, which can also be separately programmed via a specific header.
